# University Coursework

This repo contains the coursework I have completed during my time studying at the University of Southampton.

# Year 2

## Semester 1

### Comp2321 - Artifical Intelligence 
Contains a chess engine written in Python utilizing Bitboard representations for O(1) board operations and bitwise move generation. The engine uses a Minimax search algorithm optomised with Alpha-Beta pruning and tuned heuristics.

Breif:
> Create a chess bot for a altered chess game played on a 5x5 board.

### Comp2321 - Programming III (Haskell)
**Coursework Mark: 81%**

Contains a variety of functional programming problems.

### Comp2311 Theory of Computing

## Semester 2


# Year 1 - First Class Honours 

## Semester 1

### Comp1300 - Technical Report
**Coursework Mark: 76%**

Contains a technical report, written in LaTex, on the technical limitations, ethical and legal challanges of implementing facial recognition systems in Southampton High Street. 

The report uses IEEEtr referencing style for its sources.

Brief: 
> Southampton City Council is considering connecting cameras in Southampton High Street to a facial recognition system in order to help monitor footfall and understand when those that have been given banning orders from the shopping centre are breaking those orders. The Leader of Southampton City Council has asked you to prepare a report on the ethical considerations around the technology in order to inform any decisions made. The report should cover: (1) the technical affordances and limitations of the technology, (2) ethical issues that would arise around the use of such technology in this context, and (3) aspects of privacy and GDPR legislation that might have a bearing on any deployment of such technology. The report needs to be evidence from academic literature.

### Comp1312 - Programming I
**Coursework Mark: 81.25%**
Contains coursework written in python to implement a virtual representation of a maze-solving game and examples of some expected inputs and ouptuts.

Algorithms ranging in complexity from left-hug to flood fill and dykstras shortest path were used. 

### Comp1314 - Data Management
**Coursework mark: 90%**

Contains coursework written using Bash, Linux terminal commands and SQL to format data and create a fully normalized database and subsequently query it. In addition there is a report written in LaTex explaining the decisions made in each part of the process.


Breif:
