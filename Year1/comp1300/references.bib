That power is the subject of intense debate—a debate that has legal implications for privacy and civil liberties, political consequences for democracy, and a range of underlying ethical issues. This chapter is a comprehensive presentation of the leading ethical issues in the debates about facial recognition technology. After defining basic terms (facial detection, facial characterization, facial verification, and facial identification), the following issues are discussed: standards, measures, and disproportionately distributed harms; erosions of trust; ethical harms associated with perfect facial surveillance; alienation, dehumanization, and loss of control; and the slippery slope debate.},

After assessing the consequences of surveillance for freedom and democracy, it argues that we should resist the surveillance delusion: the assumption that surveillance has no significant moral costs. Under the surveillance delusion, only the benefits of surveillance are considered, and, as a result, surveillance is taken to be a convenient solution to problems that could be solved through less intrusive means—all without realizing that surveillance itself may be creating more weighty problems in the long run than the ones it is solving.},
